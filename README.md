## Project Description
**TalkIt** is a supportive platform for women to share their experiences with abuse or personal struggles. Others can offer encouragement and advice through comments, fostering a positive community. A built-in chatbot provides legal guidance to help users navigate their situations.

---

## The Problem Statement
Many women facing abuse or personal struggles often feel unheard, unsupported, or unaware of their legal rights. Existing platforms may lack a dedicated, safe space for them to share their experiences and receive guidance. There is a need for a community-driven solution where women can openly discuss their challenges, get support from others, and access legal assistance in a secure and non-judgmental environment.

---

## The Solution
**TalkIt** provides a **safe and supportive** platform for women to share their experiences with abuse or personal struggles. Users can:
- Post their stories.
- Receive encouragement and advice through comments.
- Engage with a community that offers emotional support.
- Access a built-in chatbot for **legal guidance**, helping them understand their rights and available courses of action.

This platform fosters **awareness, empowerment, and a sense of belonging**, ensuring that no one has to face their struggles alone.
