Project Description
TalkIt is a supportive platform for women to share their experiences with abuse or personal struggles. Others can offer encouragement and advice through comments, fostering a positive community. A built-in chatbot provides legal guidance to help users navigate their situations.

The Problem statement 

Many women facing abuse or personal struggles often feel unheard, unsupported, or unaware of their legal rights. Existing platforms may lack a dedicated, safe space for them to share their experiences and receive guidance. There is a need for a community-driven solution where women can openly discuss their challenges, get support from others, and access legal assistance in a secure and non-judgmental environment.

The Solution
TalkIt provides a safe and supportive platform for women to share their experiences with abuse or personal struggles. Users can post their stories, receive encouragement and advice through comments, and engage with a community that offers emotional support. Additionally, a built-in chatbot provides legal guidance, helping women understand their rights and available courses of action. This platform fosters awareness, empowerment, and a sense of belonging, ensuring that no one has to face their struggles alone.
